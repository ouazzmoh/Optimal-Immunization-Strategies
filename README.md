# Optimal-Immunization-Strategies 
This script concludes a research work that I have done about the optimization of immunization strategies.  
The script models the population as a Scale free network using the Barabasi-Albert algorithm.  
It compares the spread of a pandemic using 3 different vaccination techniques:  

  1. Random: Choosing randomly the nodes to vaccinate.  
  2. Targeted: Choosing the nodes with the highest degrees to vaccinate.  
  3. Acquaintance Immunization: Choosing a random group of nodes, choosing random nodes from their neighbors and immunizing them.  
</a> 
The result show that the Targeted stategy gives the best results and the random strategy gives the worst results, however the targeted strategy is a techniquethat's quite difficult to realise. The acquaintace immunization gives us a middle ground between the two.  
For more information and theoritical analysis of the strategies refer to the following paper.
